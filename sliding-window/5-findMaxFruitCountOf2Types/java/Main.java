//Problem Statement :Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your goal
// is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
//
//You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot,
// i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
//
//Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

//Observation : Here we need to understand that they're referring subarray with max length consisting of K unique characters
//Here K = 2
